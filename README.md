# Random Hopper
A web application for managing tasks, while only viewing one at a time and
locking the rest out of sight. The hope being to reduce the overwhelmingness
of long task lists.

The premise is that you create "hoppers" that act as black boxes to store your
tasks, doling them out one at a time when you're ready to work on them.
Task selection is random per hopper, meaning you never need to know where to start.

## Production Instance

An instance of this application can be found at [RandomHopper.com](https://www.randomhopper.com/).
It is hosted by Heroku with a PostgreSQL backend.
